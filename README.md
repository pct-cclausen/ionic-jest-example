# Reproduction of issues testing Ionic components with jest

- Run npm install to setup all dependencies first.
- Run npm run serve to see the ion-searchbar in the browser, so you can check out its html structure "in the real world"
- Run npm run test to run the one test file, `apps/test-app/src/app/app.component.spec.ts` which contains the test that fails. See that file for more information.
